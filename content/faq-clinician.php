This was to allow for 													   sufficient consultation with services and risk management protocols to be 												explored and implemented.
					 								<br /><br />
					 								Due to increasing demand for out of session access to the tools, out of session access is now available. Guidance documents have been created and circulated to ensure that services are adhering to their own risk management protocols and are responsible for providing out of session access in a safe and responsible way; using clinical judgement to determine which young people have this level of access.
					 								<br /><br />
					 								As part of the development of out of session access, we have ensured that clinicians are free to use their judgement to determine different levels of access. That is; clinicians can select between tools which are locked (not accessible), viewed or edited by the young person. We have also created a pop up message to appear every time a young person logs in independently to ensure EBPU safeguarding policies have been followed. The message reads:
					 								<br /><br />
					 								<q>Please note that anything you do or write in this area between now and your next session will not be seen by anyone else. To find out more about accessing IncludeME out of your sessions, please speak to your practitioner. If you would like additional help and support, please have a look at the list of helplines in the ‘help’ area of the platform or speak to your GP or someone in your support network. In an emergency requiring immediate help, please call 999 or go to your local A&E department.</q>';

					 								It is hoped that the platform will provide clinicians with easy access to a ‘toolbox’ of clinical tools and materials which can be used successfully with a range of children and young people in a variety of settings.

					 								<br /><br />
					 								Feedback from young people as part of our initial consultation indicated very positive attitudes towards the platform, and we hope that through continued refinement and iterative development, we will have a tool that supports rather than risks therapeutic alliance.
					 								<br /><br />
					 								At the same time however, there will always be clinicians and young people that don’t want to use any online tools, and we are not trying to create a “one-size-fits all” product.
					 								<br /><br />
					 								There is also literature in this area which the team have reviewed and can direct you to. General findings suggest that attitudes towards existing web based platforms are broadly positive, and do not negatively impact therapeutic alliance.';

				 									<br /><br />
													We acknowledge that the platform is likely to take longer to get used to during the earlier stages of the project, as it will be unfamiliar and very new to lots of clinicians.
