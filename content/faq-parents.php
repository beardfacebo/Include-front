$arrFAQs[$arrayIndex]["answer"] = 'IncludeME is an exciting and innovative interactive platform, designed to support and improve the care that children and young people receive when accessing mental health services; in clinics, schools and the community. 
										<br /><br />
										The platform has been created as part of a 3 year project, developed by the EBPU at the Anna Freud Centre and funded by the Department of Health. The EBPU are working with software developers SilverCloudHealth to develop the platform and service user participation organisation Common Room. The platform has been designed over a phased roll-out, over which time feedback from young people, clinicians, teachers and stakeholders has allowed us to develop and refine a platform which is user friendly, engaging and relevant for young people and those supporting them.
										<br /><br />
										The platform has been created to encourage young people and their supporters to take an active role in the care they receive, by widening the boundaries to communication and providing vulnerable young people and their families with the opportunity to have their voices heard. 
										<br /><br />
										IncludeME is most often used in session with a worker using a tablet or computer. Some workers may also grant young people out of session access so they can access the resources or complete measures in their own time at home.';

										<br /><br />
										<ul>
											<li>Help young people and therapists jointly review progress and set goals;</li>
											<li>Encourage young people to reflect on their strengths and explore relationships;</li>
											<li>Help young people understand their rights and increase their knowledge about options;</li>
											<li>Facilitate the young person sharing information and self-manage;</li>
											<li>Provide an easy way of completing and reviewing questionnaires.</li>

$arrFAQs[$arrayIndex]["answer"] = 'No, many of the tools available on the platform are not age specific, with the exception of age limitations on certain questionnaires. The platform was originally designed for young people aged 10-14, however, this isn’t set in stone and it can be used by both younger and older children. This means that young people of any age can use the platform if their clinician or support worker thinks it would be helpful. ';

The only time that information might be taken from the platform is if you or you young person complete a questionnaire.

There are no limits in terms of how much access parents have to the platform and, if a young person and their worker agree, there is no reason why a young person’s parents could not be involved in using some of the other tools too.';
